a collection of UI Elements built on the CreateJS Framework

This project is my attempt at creating a collection of controls people can use when implementing thier own applications using 
CreateJS.  The central control is the FrameEngine.  This control, along with many other controls, will simplify the construction
of windows or screens, for visual separation, as well as minute control over transitioning between "Frames" which are simply
Special Canvas elements.

as of 07/21/2014... this project is currently being uploaded with my initial sloppy code I wrote, before I discovered
that other people were searching for controls.  I made a couple while implementing POC code to learn CreateJS.

I will update asap until its ready for others to work with.
